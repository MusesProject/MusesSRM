## Working with it

You will have to download the version of Netbeans than contains all components (especially important NetBeans Platform SDK and Apache Tomcat) from [here](https://netbeans.org/downloads/). The plain 7.0 version you download from OS repos will not cut it. The JDK from the repos won't either, you'll have to install it [from a PPA](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html). 

During the installation of NetBeans is important to remember that in the section on customizing the installation is necessary to check the option to install Apache Tomcat because this is disabled by default. On the other hand, JDK installation will take place automatically.
