## Working with it

You will have to download the full enterprise version of Netbeans from [here](https://netbeans.org/downloads/). The plain 7.0 version you download from OS repos will not cut it. The JDK from the repos won't either, you'll have to install it [from a PPA](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html)
